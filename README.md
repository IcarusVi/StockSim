# Stock Simulator

Stock Simulator is a full stack project of mine, meant to introduce users to the stock market.
Users will be able to search for stocks, buy and sell stocks, add those stocks to their own portfolios, and able to see visualizations of their portfolios.

## Features

1. Users will be able to login with Google, Facebook, or guest login. (More login strategies will be introduced in the future)

2. Users will be able to create portfolios where they can add stocks. 

3. Users will be able to search for stocks using the search bar located in the header.

4. Users will be able to purchase and sell searchable stocks. Users will be able to see the last year worth of prices for a stock.

5. Users will be able to see a pie chart which represents the total value of their portfolio.

6. Users will be able to logout and have their portfolios with stocks saved.
